If you can write your questions or some other things in English, 
please write them in English. 

Since Jim-san is very kind, 
so that in case you get spelling error, 
or write in incorrect grammar, 
he will be able to understand what you want to say. 

Those who cannot understand English may write them in Japanese. 
Accommodating persons will translate for you. 

このスレッドは、ピンクちゃんねるの管理人さんのジムさんと 
英語でお話しようスレです。 
英語できる人は、できれば英語で書いてくださいな。 
ジムさんは、とってもやさしいので 
文法とか単語のつづりが「かなり間違っている」英語でも 
きっとわかってくれますよん。 

英語はどうしても無理、って人は日本語でどうぞ。 
親切な人がきっと翻訳してくれます。

自分の質問は以下の通りです。  

1.なぜ規制に反対したか。  
2.ボランティアで動いてくれていた2ちゃん側に感謝はなかったのか。  
3.2ちゃんの規制ガイドラインに反対するなら、代案はあるのか。それは実行可能か。  
4.2ちゃん運営側の協力なしで、運営していくことはできるのか。  
5.なによりも、今回の大規模アラシを、管理者としてどうするつもりなのか。

Following is my question 

1/Why were you against blocking syste before? 
2/Didn't you feel any feeling of gratitude who are working as volunteer in 2ch? 
3/IF you are against 2ch blocking system plan, do you have any alternative ideas? and are those practicall available? 
4/Can you run bbspink without 2ch help? 
5/Moreover, what are you going to deal with this vandalism as manager of bbspink?"

I am sorry that you may be sick of hearing flood of questions from everybody, 
Ms. Greenday was saying there were disagreement about blocking system between you. 
I am asking you below because I am not sure if you know the details of the blocking system. 

Do you want us to explain current 2ch blocking system? (how it works, how it operates, etc) 
   For example,  (BBQ, BBM, Rock54/54M, Samba24, ByeSaru) the ones that were removed in current disaster  
                      and/or ISP blocking system"

Thank you Jim-san! 
I didn't know that phrase. Now I'm smarter than before! 
By the way, I'm really glad we BBSPINK members survived those tough events  
of the past few days. 
Of course, I know there are lots of problem remained unsolved.  
And I know those problems have to be solved because they are the main point 
 of this issue. 
It's gonna be tough work. 
However, now I just wanna express my gratitude to people who saved my favorite  
thread! Thank you all including you and Hiroyuki the master of 2ch who must 
have worked hard to get us through that ARASHI's terrible attack. 
We can't see each other directly, so it's difficult to grab what's going on

arrogant? does it sounds like so, Jim?  If so, it is because of my English skill. 
79 is not technical person, and I doubt if she explained Jim in detail what kind of  
protection system is on currently for BBSPINK as well as 2ch.  If Jim does not have enough 
knowledge about the system and what kind of control BBSPINK has currently, 
it might be a good idea to explain them now (as he now know the importance of them) 
for changing current system situation or might give him a hint for developing a new p 
rotection system, as he mentioned."

Right before Christmas the blocking system was removed from PINKちゃんねる 
This was done because of a communication error. I became angry as well. 
It is easy to lose your temper when things are falling apart quickly. 
After a lot of discussion the cause of the communication breakdown 
was determined and the blocking system was restored. 
Thank you for all the help from the volunteers. They are appreciated so much.

Jimさん。 
皆からの洪水のような質問にうんざりしているかもしれませんね。申し訳なく思います。 
79さんはあなたとの間に規制システムについて意見の不一致があったと仰っていました。 
あなたが規制システムの詳細を知っているのか定かでないので、以下についてお尋ねします。 
現在の2chについて、我々による説明が必要でしょうか？（どのように作動するのか、操作するのか、等） 
例えば、この災害で取り除かれている(BBQ, BBM, Rock54/54M, Samba24, バイ猿) について 
または（あるいはそれと共に）ISPブロックについてなど。 

70： 
傲慢ですか？　Jimさん、そのように聞こえましたでしょうか？ 
もしそうでしたら、私の英語力不足ですね。 
79は専門家ではありません。 
それで、２ちゃんねると同じようにBBSPINKにおいてどのような規制システムが 
導入されているのかを、彼女がJimに説明したのかどうか疑問を持っているのです。 
もしJimがBBSPINKのシステムや運営組織について十分な知識を有していないなら、 
現在の組織体制を変えるために今ここで説明するというのは良い考えかもしれません。 
あるいは、彼が言及したような新たな規制システムを構築するヒントになるかも。

Thank you. 

I think the following format is better. 

Some servers are placed as ""backyard"" server (e.g. deleter), 
and the servers are not served BBS and other services for external users. 
So, I think these servers should not be listed publically, I think.

Jim-san, 
I wrote a comment to 79. Roughly translation version is as follows. 
Please point it out when my remark is not appropriate. 

-- 
79, 

All of Jim-san's approval should be opened clearly at bbspink itself. 
It should be fully-disclosed for all project members and bbspink users. 
79, you don't understand bbspink is fully-opened BBS for discussion. 
If you do not so, all members cannot do it be trusted. 

You wrote ""The project is private consented from Jim-san."". 
What is ""private consented""? Statement itself? Project's outline? 
or some other matters? 
I cannot understand it. 

And I wrote ""Please rename the file name including 'alpha' for displaying 
alpha-version."" Can't you read it? 
Version control and some other my sugestions are only technical matters. 
You do not ignore a part of the essence intentionally. OK? 

Such a kind of rename from ""policy"" to ""_policy"" is meaningless 
because the link URL does not tell the description of it. 

And at last, you please stop doing completely different things after 
saying ""Hai, wakarimashita"". 

Before you say ""Hai, wakarimashita"", you must describe your understanding 
about the matter, and you don't do anything after approval that your 
understanding is correct."

Well... Mr.Jim, you had better leave a space between words when you write in Japanese as you do in English. 

Sentences having a space between words are more easily read

And... you had better leave ""。""(句点,kuten) at the end of sentences like a period.

Welcome back, Jim-san.

I'm sorry to disturb the conversation. 
This is my opinion.  

Although you have agreed to the procedure of policy statement creation above, I have another an idea. 
I think it's better you yourself create the policy statement, 
because bbspink is owned by you and the statement defines your responsibility. 
In addition, I think the statement originated by you can make bbspink users understand your thought further and exactly, 
and make your friends in 2ch relieved. Then they can help you on bbspink operation easily. 

Best regards,

This is part of situation on BBSPINK. 
(thanks for translation and help.) 


First of all, Jim-san may wonder why FOX-san and Mumumu-san only post indirect 
expression what they want BBSPINK(or Jim-san) to do. That is because 
if they say it directly, it is perceived as a demand from 2ch to BBSPINK and 
the police may determine that is the evidence BBSPINK is under 2ch's control. 

In the past, a person who are doing server maintenance for 2ch was questioned by police. 
""You must be somehow related with BBSPINK because you are doing the server 
maintenance(reboot remotely, etc)"" He answered them that he was helping JIM and 
doing so for a part of business practices. The police did not believe him 
because there must be a contract or order statement should exist if it is 
for business. Then he quits doing sever reboot etc., for BBSPINK so that he 
would not be doubted by the police that he is somehow related to BBSPINK. 
Police has a tendency to doubt the things without evidence while they are investigating. 

The people who does server setup and maintenance would like to have as many firm evidences 
such as public statement at BBSPINK site, order statement, etc. as possible to present to 
the police that they are unrelated to BBSPINK and the police should ask JIM-san about the 
BBSPINK. It seems that they are reluctant to help BBSPINK without such evidence. 
You said that you will not make official paper(contract or order statements., etc) 
Although I have no idea that it may be possible to do so in closed fashion, I would 
like to suggest you should talk with your friend by mail or phone, knowing the friend 
cannot demand something to BBSPINK openly.

Jim-san, 

Japanese officers probably can not distinguish from 2ch to bbspink. 
So then they've thrown suspicion or unreasonable requirements on your friends 2ch guys 
who help bbspink server operation and are identified by the officers. 

In order to make your friends get out of such a unreasonable situation, 
it must be needed to clarify the bbspink responsible is Jim and is dependent from 2ch. 
I don't know what's the best way to convince the wrong-headed Japanese officers. 
announcement of policy statement? or some papers? or any other...? 

I think we must not discuss on open place what should be done, 
because it produces misunderstanding if a japanese officer finds it. 
I'd like to ask you to contact your friends directly. 
By doing that, I believe the best solution can be found. 

We all hope that you and your friends can enjoy operating and maintaining bbspink both now and in the future.

日本の役人には、2chとBBSPINKの区別が付かないのだと思います。

不当な要求をしてしまうようです。 

あなたの友人が理不尽な目に遭わないように、BBSPINKの責任者はJimさんであることを明確にしなければなりません。 
頭の固い日本の役人を納得させるベストな方法が何かは、私には分かりません。 
ポリシーステートメントに明記すればよいのか、契約書を作ればよいのか、それとも他の何か... 

どうすれば良いかは、きっとオープンな場で話すべき事柄でないと私は思います。 
なぜなら、それを見つけたら日本の役人が誤解をする可能性があるからです。 
あなたの友人に直接コンタクトしてみてください。 
きっと最善な解決策が見つかることでしょう。 

あなたとあなたの友人が楽しみながらBBSPINKを維持出来る様になることを、私たちは願っています。"

1.Volunteers might have the ability to cause damage to PINKちゃんねる 
This document does not absolve them of their responsibility if 
they vandalize PINKちゃんねる . 
2. Due to the open architecture of PINKちゃんねる It is possible for 
other sites to access the dat files on our servers. Non technical 
people would think that those sites were PINKちゃんねる , and not 
the actual PINKちゃんねる. This could cause confusion, and delay reporting 
important things that should be reported. Causing me to be liable for something 
that was really only a error. I want to reserve the right to block those sites 
that do not have a clear link to http://www.bbspink.com/ with these words exactly PINKちゃんねる

This is kind of important as the servers I am having inode problem

Jim-san, 

On FreeBSD, users can use tunefs command for tuning some filesystem 
parameters, but tunefs can't increase number of inodes. 

I think you can increase inodes by using newfs -i 2048 option, 
but it will initialize the filesystem. So you need to evacuate your whole data 
from the disk, unfortunately."

437	1198689181	438			MUMUMUhnYI		2008-01-10 15:48:47	gQNv4aDX	" Jim-san, 

In all 2ch servers, we never see any 'out of inodes' messages 
except for /md (memory disk for temporary files) partition. 

And we've already done increasing inodes for each memory disks 
for all 2ch servers. So, I think it does not affect 2ch and bbspink servers."

saying the same thing. I need to start over fresh. 
This is one of the reasons I don't want to double up servers though. 
I think it might be dangerous for us. Maybe we should slow down 
our move to the new servers, and just do it one server for one server. 
I have ordered 3 servers. 2 for the boards and one for the headline. 
We could delay the headline upgrade, and use the 3 for boards, and wait 
a little while for the headline and the 4 server upgrade. Don't you 
think it is better not to take a chance?"

Ah, I understand what you concerned. 
Do you worry about the density of the server increasing for BBSPINK bbs, perhaps? 

If so, I believe that the worry is not necessary. 

We, including Fox and I, have been operated many 2ch BBS servers 
for over 5 years. And in the current 2ch tbanana servers, there are 
high-capacity servers. 

Always I and some good 2ch volunteers check the current board placements, 
and almost of all tbanana servers are well-tuned. 

You can see the current servers' and boards' placement information in my webpage: 
http://mumumu.mu/serverlist.html 
It includes bbspink servers/boards information, too. 

And we've operated 1T HDD server, named oyster902 with Suma 
for over 4 years. And its /home HDD is almost full, but the usage of 
inodes is only 19%, as seen below: 

% df -i /home 
Filesystem 1K-blocks        Used    Avail Capacity  iused     ifree %iused  Mounted on 
/dev/da0   1417529014 1227329072 76797622    94% 35531154 147703404   19%   /home 

I mean, I believe the 'out of inodes' does not occur in 2ch and bbspink servers 
for usual. So, we can relax about it."

I explain about your concern (>>402) as below... 

In 2ch manner, new server is given its own new name. 
For example, when ""etc6.2ch.net"" server is replaced, 
new server is given ""etc7.2ch.net"" as new server name. 
(And old etc6.2ch.net will move to ""kakolog"" server later) 

And some kinds of reason, e.g. server load issue, 
some boards are moved between 2ch servers sometimes, e.g. 
http://news24.2ch.net/newsplus/ to http://mamono.2ch.net/newsplus/ 

Anyway, when the movings, each board URIs of in the server have been changed, 
e.g. http://etc6.2ch.net/dataroom/ to http://etc7.2ch.net/dataroom/ . 

I think you have two concerns, 
1) When board URI is changed, do users stray from the board? 
2) When server is changed, do users have to make the new threads? 

But both are no problem. 
I will explain the reason in my next res. 

But, I have to take a bath now. Chotto mattete kudasai."

1) In 2ch manner, each boards are moved to the new URI, each the old URI have 
""the moving mark"" to the new URI, during the moving operations by Fox-san. 

e.g. You can access ""Feti"" board in bbspink at old URI, 
http://wow.bbspink.com/feti/ . It is automatically redirected to 
http://pie.bbspink.com/feti/ . So, I believe that when boards in 
pie, and sakura0[1-3] will be moved, users will redirect to new URI. 
So, you don't have to worry about 1), I think. 

2) In 2ch manner, each boards are moved to the new URI, all live threads are 
copied into the new bbs, during the moving operation by Fox-san. 
So, users can access all live thread in the new URI again, and 
I think you don't have to worry about 2), too. 

And many users refers ""BBS menu in 2ch"" to access each boards, 
in http://menu.2ch.net/bbsmenu.html and http://menu.2ch.net/bbstable.html . 
These bbsmenu and bbstable are updated frequently enough, by diligent 
2ch volunteer Mahora-san. So, users don't lose their access way."

475	1198689181	476			MUMUMUhnYI		2008-01-14 13:04:47	E6YJW4gq	" Jim-san, 

I must tell ""The life of virtual host name of 2ch"" to you. 
It is a little bit long, but it is very important. 
Please read carefully and please understand well. 

1) In the beginning 

It is fresh virtual host, it is brand-new. 

2) Growing up 

Users make threads, write many reses, discuss and sometimes flames. 
So, the bulletin boards prosper, and lands are made. 

3) Refreshment operation 

As the result, each virtual hosts have so many kakologs. 
Then, the cost that each server uses to provide kakologs grows bigger 
and bigger.  

(continue)"
476	1198689181	477			MUMUMUhnYI		2008-01-14 13:05:10	E6YJW4gq	" (continue from >>476) 

Then we carry out refreshment operation to divide it into another server.  
The refreshment operation is as follows: 

a) _add_ a different virtual host at the current server 
　usually in 2ch, it is ""the increasing name"", e.g. for society5, 2ch will 
　add society6 in the _same_ server hardware. 

b) all of live threads are moved (called ""Iten"") to new virtual 
　host, but all kakologs are NOT moved. they are left in old virtual host. 

c) after that, we move old virtual host to kakolog server, it has very 
　disk space. 2ch already has two kakolog servers, oyster902+Suma and 
　banana3000. They are specially tuned for providing kakologs. 

d) as a result, we can divide the kakolog load from live servers. 

4) End of Life 

Time goes by, and server greets its life. Any kind of high-performance 
server must come to retire itself in several years, so, the progress of 
the hardware is amazing. 

It is time of this, we moved all of live thread to brand new servers. 
And we move a dead body of virtual host into kakolog servers."
477	1198689181	478			MUMUMUhnYI		2008-01-14 13:05:50	E6YJW4gq	" (continue from >>477) 

This is the cruel theory of 2ch. We have already have a dead body of 
a lot of virtual hosts in oyster902 and banana3000. 
The number of over 200, please see http://mumumu.mu/serverlist.html 
at oyster902 section. 2ch gives the name for oyster902 and banana3000 
to ""memories.2ch.net"" and ""memories2.2ch.net"", with affection for the past. 

So, pie, sakura01, sakura02 and sakura03 are old. 
I think we would operate 4) in the above."
478	1198689181	479			MUMUMUhnYI		2008-01-14 13:07:41	E6YJW4gq	" Jim-san, 

Mochiron, we can set two or more virtual hosts per server without 
any additional IP address if it is technically needed, it is technically 
very easy, only Apache's matter. 

Really, in 2ch, we already set virtual hosts more than 2 to some servers. 
e.g. banana3206 have three virtual hosts, academy6.2ch.net, 
science6.2ch.net, and society6.2ch.net. These virtual hosts have 
different board settings, for good BBS operations. 

so, if we needed two or more virtual hosts per server technically 
and operationally, we can _add_ more two virtual hosts _atode_. 
As I wrote before, it is technically easy. 

That's all. 
I believe our tomorrow is better than today. 
Let's play a game together.

Sorry for my wording is so poor. 

Of course, if you need four or more virtual hosts, you can set them. 

It is only I wanted to say is that two or four new names are not

They have different names, and I've relieved you understand it probably.

Thanks... 

May I have a question? 

Mochiron, you can have two or more IP address per server, 
it is technically easy, you and I already know. 

But, Apache can set two or more virtual hosts in the same IP address, 
it saves IP address resources. 

Do you have special reasons for separate IP address?"

I collect the result of the discussion as follows: 

1) I (= Jim-san) don't want to reduce the number of servers in the appearance. 
2) So, I want to set four names and IP addresses totally. 
3) I know their names are different from pie, sakura01, sakura02 and sakura03.

Hello Jim-san. 
I have worked at the Transulation thread for these past 1 month and put a trip on myself today. 
I am looking forward to working for you and BBSPINK in the upcoming year.

It looks like there are some comunication gaps becouse of machine translation's imperfection. 
Yeah, I don't write English very well as you see, but there are a lot of volunteers.

mmm...Futon(布団：ふとん) means usually about a bed. 
Futon can also distinguish between shiki-buton(敷き布団：しきぶとん) and　kake-buton（掛け布団:かけぶとん）. 

Kake-buton means usually about a quilt or bed colothes, which put over someone. 
Shiki-buton is a kind of mattress under the body.  
In Japanese style of bed(such as http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F:Stage_of_Japanese_pillow_fight.jpg), 
a shiki-buton is put on the tatami (or sometimes another mattress put between tatami and shiki-buton in order to make more comftable). 
Japanese Onsen Ryokan (Japanese style of Hotel) uses such style.  


Please refer to the wikipedia's website( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futon) in detail.

Right now, David, Tom, Brian and Robert are discussing the configuration of the Force 10. 
During phase 1, the Force 10 configuration did not work. We had the  
configuration verified by Force 10, and there was a line missing. That line was not in the manual. The line is added now. 
It still doesn't work, so discussion is being done on what to try next.

This is Mumumu., 
Why you login and change password of tiger2514? 
I cannot login it now! 

Tiger2514 is 2ch's server, and I was tuning it up with OS upgrading. 
However, the work was still on the way, so, 
httpd is now intentionally down by me. 

Certainly, we moved all old contents to banana3000 and its all done. 
But we will still use tiger2514 for 2ch's other things, 
and now I am working in progress. 

So, you did two mistakes. 
This is the same as what you made tiger509 and tiger510 in May, 2003. 

1) You logged in to customer's(2ch's) server without any prior notices. 
2) And you chaned the password. 

Please set a password again immediately.  
And please do not login the customer's(2ch's) server again. 
This is a problem of the trust between you and 2ch. 
Please understand this. 

-- Mumumu, as voluntary engineer of 2ch"

There is no mistake. Our employees have orders to get httpd back up asap. The customer needs to fill out a ticket and say they are doing work like that. The only way they can get into machine is to change the password. I posted immediately when they did that on the pinknanmin board.  
PIE guys followed orders strictly and correctly. 
I will put the password in your email now."

Hmm, 

I think that it is some kind of misorders, and the monitoring 
of tiger2514 should be stopped now. 
It is now still under reconstruction. 

So, I believe PIE has to coordinate about monitoring of tiger2514 
with relational guys about setting of the server monitoring. 

and I will order it later. I understand now you are very busy for 
core-router upgrading work.

Here is what happens at http://www.pie.us when a server or service 
goes down. 
1. Pie's noc staff is notified by our monitoring software. 
None of our staff know what is on a server or what a client is doing 
unless that client informs them. 
2. The staff attempts to access the machine by ssh if that is not 
possible they attempt a reboot. 
3. If machine does not come up after a reboot then a console is 
connected to the machine, to find out the error. 
4. Unless we have prior orders from the client, the staff is under 
orders to get the machine to command prompt and httpd back up. 
5. If the password for the machine is not on file, then they will 
reset the password and find the solution.  

After those steps, our senior noc tech found that you had commented out 
httpd. That is why I posted about it. He knew it was a 2ch machine 
and very important to get back up. He did not know you were working on it."

Formerly, 2ch blocked Baiduspider, but now 2ch does not block it. 

And .htaccess of all BBS servers of bbspink is now shared with 2ch by 2ch's blocking system, 
so, I believe that both 2ch and bbspink do not block any accesses from Baiduspider."

Regarding the issue some requests to delete a bbspink content are still posted to 2-channel instead of bbspink, 
I'd like to ask you not to provide links to 2-channel contents;

The people who are not familiar with bbspink post a delete-request to 2-channel by using the current link above. 
I feel sorry for the late request, but we didn't pick up on this up to now. 

In passing, I'd like to recommend you to improve other links  
such a way to resolve it by yourself bbspink, without 2-channel contents.

Although I told you the other day that we have a plan to build ""Setsumei-nin"" framework, 
our continuous discussion has made us painfully aware of necessity of further knowledge 
on framework, workflow, each role of functions, principle and basic concept of 2-channel's posting control system. 
Consequently, we've held a study session and visit various 2-channel threads related to it, 
and then we will learn more about it and exchange views on it with each other. 
It's important for bbspink to have deep understanding on the posting control to use it under cooperation with 2-channel. 
We'd like to keep you in the loop.

Since bbspink is using 2ch's posting control system, we (bbspink users) should cooperate in order to make the system work better. 
""Setsumei-nin"" will take the work to give and take information both ways, which we think it will be a good start for cooperation. 

Background: 
1. Because of 2ch's posting control, people in bbspink got caught, which lead to making complains to 2ch's operators. 
2. At the same time, people in bbspink didn't have a strong opinion in using 2ch's system, and some people start thinking it was annoying. 
3. Then the trouble suddlenly occured last year, which made us think more about taking communication and cooperating. 

What ""Setsumei-nin"" does: 
""Setsumei-nin"" will explain to people who get in trouble because of the 2ch's posting control system. 
Before people goes to 2ch operator, ""Setsumei-nin"" will give sources and lead them to place where they can talk how the problem can be improved. 

This is just only a draft, and we are planning to finish it up by studying about 2ch's system at the same time. 
But since this activaty will also be held outside of bbspink (in 2ch), we need to be careful there are no mistakes, 
therefore we need Jim-san's knowledge and cooperation."

OK, Jim. Thanks.  
So concerning dating issue, the local rules comply with Japanese law.  
Now we are discussing on BE's capability of dating.  
Of course we know Be is originally not for dating, but it can provide measures for dating.  
That's why we are concerned that Japanese police could assume bbspink with BE is a dating site.  
We have an analogical case in Japan.  
A famous P2P software Winny was judged as guilty on content copyright infringement,  
although the original development purpose was not for exchange copyright music/video contents."

Jim-san, 
You seem to have some misunderstanding on >>687, so let me make some comment. 

That's a request from the leader of 2-channel deleters 削ジェンヌ, not a troll. 
She says it's inconvenient for bbspink users and 2-channel deleters to keep the current links. 
Because due to the links, some bbspink users make a delete-request of a bbspink content to 2-channel instead of bbspink. 
So she called on bbspink to create bbspink's own information pages and switch the links to them."

It is bad that we are even discussing that I think because it is just giving

お邪魔します。  

BBSPINKの削除依頼が未だに２ちゃんねるに出される件についてなのですが  
板トップにある  
『書き込む前に読んでね』  
『２ちゃんねるガイド』  
『FAQ』  
『掲示板一覧』  
は、BBSPINK独自のものをお使いください。  
普段御サイトをお使いになっていない方はそのリンクを使って  
２ちゃんねるの削除板に依頼をされてしまう形になりまので  
早急に変更をお願い致します。  
これまでこちらも気づかずに、ご連絡が遅くなってしまい申し訳ありませんでした。  

また、これはついでなのですが  
例で言うと  
http://qiufen.bbspink.com/soap/ 
板トップの  
●初心者が安心して質問できるスレッドガイダンス 　　  
●初心者の質問板  
等のリンクも、御サイト内で解決出来るよう改善されたほうがよろしいのではないかと思っております。"

Dear. 

I would like to tell you about a matter which delete request in BBSPINK still submit to 2-channel. 
On the top of the BBS, please use the PINKBBS version's 
『書き込む前に読んで(Please read before a entry)』  
『２ちゃんねるガイド(A guide of 2-channel)』  
『FAQ』  
『掲示板一覧 (a list of BBS)』 . 
People who usually do not use PINK BBS, use the links there, and they submit the request to the delete request-board on 2-channel. So please change above fact as soon as possible. 
I am apologies that I make contact with you late. 

In passing let me say that, I think, for example, the links of 
●初心者が安心して質問できるスレッドガイダンス (the thread guidance for the beginner to ask question in peace of mind ) 
●初心者の質問板 (the question thread for the guidance ). 
on the top of the board, http://qiufen.bbspink.com/soap/, should be changed by Pink BBS.

963	1198689181	964		名無し編集部員			2008-02-10 06:10:03	EwCIQPdG	" Hi, Jim. 

A girl is slandered here.  
http://qiufen.bbspink.com/test/read.cgi/nuki/1199536811/89 
[I had money extracted by Wakana from a wallet] 

She is considered as the thief without the basis.  
However, although asked how many times, 79 does not delete.  
Jim, Would you persuade 79?"

http://deleter.bbspink.com/ 
It is not good just to ask people directly. Follow the procedure."
965	1198689181	966		Jim	6P7QkQf8Ys	＠Apparently admin	2008-02-10 10:27:55	???	" If you are going to go to a private hotel room with a prostitute. 
You should watch your wallet. Girls are evil, and prostitutes are 
generally basic girl units. Do you leave your wallet on the table? 
Of course your money will be gone after you take a shower. I don't 
even think it is stealing. I think you were just very stupid not to 
watch your wallet. Is this slander if someone writes about it? I am 
not sure, and need to think on that, but I do know this. It shows 
how very stupid the customer was to have his money stolen."
966	1198689181	967		名無し編集部員			2008-02-10 16:02:12	EwCIQPdG	" >>965 
According to procedure, the deletion request of this is carried out formally. 
However, 79 does not delete and not explain the reason which is not deleted. 
The person who wrote in is unknown and there is no proof of the fact. 
This is clear slander and will bring her disadvantageous profit. 
This should conflict with a deletion guideline clearly. 
Why doesn't 79 delete this? It is the reason that I want to know. 
If allowed to say honestly, 79's Japanese is more unclear than English of Jim. 

>>966 
I agree with the opinion of Jim. But it is not related.  
It is a problem that the girl is slandered."

then you just need to work harder to get a good review."

Followings are FYI.  

Most jurisdictions also recognize ""per se"" defamation, where the allegations are presumed to cause damage to the plaintiff.  
Typically, the following may consititute defamation per se: 

Attacks on a person's professional character or standing;  
Allegations that an unmarried person is unchaste;  
Allegations that a person is infected with a sexually transmitted disease;  
Allegations that the person has committed a crime of moral turpitude;
