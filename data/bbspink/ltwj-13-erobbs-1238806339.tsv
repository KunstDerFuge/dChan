レストランで鶏のもも肉のソテーを注文したら、すし桶ほどのデカイ皿に骨付きのもも肉が４本と、瓦解寸前のポテトの山が出てきた。 
俺はてっきり何かの間違いだと思ったら、これが一人前だとウエイトレスのネーちゃんは誇らしく宣言するではないか。  

反則だよな〜と毒づきつつ、ドミグラスソースの中で泳ぐ肉を、切り分ける。  
ヒトも肥満ならトリも肥満なのか、たっぷりと厚みのあるもも肉は、さぞや太っていた鶏のものであろうことは想像に難くない。 
大量の油で揚げるように焼かれたであろうもも肉一本を、どうにか平らげて尚、絶望的な量が皿には残っている。  
一向に減らないポテトの山を前に溜息をついていると、今度は巨大サラダが参戦してきた。  
サラダ付とは書いてあったが、洗面器に入っているとは書いてなかったハズだ…  
しかもこれ、クリームサラダか？と疑うほどチーズソースがごってり。 
3口で胃が喉元でうごめく。  
「お願いします。もう勘弁して下さい…」と泣きが入った俺は、勘定を頼もうとウエイトレスを呼んだ。 
すると「あ、デザートですね。今お持ちします」と、最後のトドメ。  
緑とﾋﾟﾝｸが毒々しくも鮮やかな、歯痛ケーキの襲撃だった。 
それは凶悪な甘さと陰謀に満ちた舌触りの代物であった。 
即刻勘定を払い、ほうほうの体で逃げ出した

Back in the days I was on stateside. One day I've been to a local restaurant. 
It was a shocking experience to hear waitress says it's what I've ordered beside  
a whole four chicken leg in a bowl around a pool big, with volcano potato about to set off. 

swimming in the pool filled by demiglace sauce, I repeatedly asked myself was it a fair deal. 
though I 've never read study  on obecitical relationships between human and chicken, but 
I knew there is. huge thick legs should've served as the only transportation for his fat body. 
the dish was only quarter finished at this point, while the volcano left untouched. wait. 
wthat's that waitres taking to me? yes. the salad --in a sink, with bunch of cheeeeese, of course. 
hold on, my stomach, no, as you, were. please. I'll call the waitress, so wait --wait. 

no. no. no. don't say dessert. the cake is a lie. the cake is a lie. I don't call that pink'n'green stuff a cake. 
I' dont call that sugarpaste a cake. Instantly I paid what I was asked for and left there without a glance.

Thank quickly response !! 

The deletion volunteer says that he or she will not open the judgment whether correspond  
to the kiddie porn to the public.  
The user asked it why. He explained saying as not saying to Mr. Jim to the user.  
Moreover, he says that he voluntarily goes to the police, and knows whether the act in  
what kind of BBS collides with the law.  
However, it explains that the standard etc. are said that it must not say from the manager.  

It was an opinion that it was necessary to wait in mail.  
Declaring to the user as a manager like this is significant.  
What can able judgment to be it, and important showing the judgment as the manager to  
the user.  
So , user trusts volunteer's act. User can control volunteer's deviating act (guide 1b).  

The snap in the going to school photograph of the woman student in Japan is included in  
the one with a large amount of data deleted as a kiddie porn.  

You approved the deletion without showing the standard of the kiddie porn.  
The manager's trust so much is dangerous for the volunteer.  

I am waiting for manager's statement.  
Clarify the deletion standard in this BBS. Is it an act that what act indicts  
to the police?

A deleter deletes child porn photo direct link as

The deleter wondered if she can take a look at the linked  
picture for checking purpose and what exactly are considered 
as child porn photos.  She talked with local police and 
they said she can look at them for deletion checking purpose. 
Then she went over to the police with deleted linked pictures

porn.   

She said that she now know what kind of photo link she should 
delete, but she has no intention to disclose the exact parameter.

pictures or think of get around way)

Justice Potter Stewart  

I examined the meaning of his word on the site in Japan.  
His word seems often to be quoted in Japan by discussing pornography.  
Very, I thought that it was a word with deep deep emotion. 

The concept of the kiddie porn in Japan is as shown in the following image.   
http://president.jp.reuters.com/article/2009/01/20/gallery/2E1C0B78-E1DF-11DD-8248-5CFA3E99CD51_slideshow_1.php 

Could a wise translator see this image? 
In the management of this bulletin board, it thinks it is important.  

Ｉｎ　276 linked photo. 
This photograph exists as not the kiddie porn but a violation of the portrait right 
even if it was necessary to delete the link as violations of privacy.  
If there are my children......(ToT 

It is hoped that the image that shows the definition of the kiddie porn  
of Japan is translated, and the deletion standard is examined.  

Thank you for correspondence in spite of a busy schedule.  
Please take care of yourself.  

敬具（keigu）"

I think that they are going to coax Jim_san hard.  
It is that people saying that Jim-san ""show the definition of the child porno"" here. 

If Jim_san define it, the people will look for a loophole. 

They showed only the item which is advantageous to oneself. 
They used a polite manner of speaking here, but always hurl dirty words at witch_san. 

I think that the ambiguous guideline is good.  
I think that an existing vague guideline is good. 
I want a vague guideline. 

It is because we performed it for a long time in this way so far.

in front of his apartment. Death in Manila is time consuming and complicated. 
When I got to the office in the morning, His wife called me almost as soon as I had walked in  
and turned on the air conditioner. 
 “Martin has been hit! Please come here I need you.” 
I left the office right away, and called back. 
 “Call a doctor it will take me some time to get there.” 
She replied, “He's dead!” 
I arrived just before 7 am, and the crowd of people was gathered with morbid curiosity as 
they cleaned the street of his dead body. 
The police took his family and I to the station for questioning, this went smoothly, and since there 
were witnesses to the crime they were able to get a good sketch of the suspect. 
We left the station at 10:30 am, and I took his wife and mother home. 
After the a quick trip to the German embassy to notify them of the death, and of course they are 
closed for half a day on Fridays. I arrived after they closed about 12:30 pm. The guard was kind enough 
to give me the emergency contact number, and I went to my office to call them. 
The Germans are very efficient in handling such things. I had his mothers phone number, and that is the only  
contact information available. The Embassy contacted the police in Germany and in no time,  
his family there was notified of the murder."

He was always telling me stories about them and how much he missed his children there. I knew where they grew up, 
it is a part of Japan I am familiar with as well. I called a friend of mine that lives close to there, and he was able to locate and notify them.  
Thank you for that. I have heard now that they did not handle the news very well, and I am so sorry about that. I hope they will contact me sometime,  
and I can talk to them and tell them some about what their father had been doing since he met them last. 
I called the police back to find out where the body had been taken. They gave me a name of a funeral home, so I started on my way to find that. 
All this time his dog had been locked up in the apartment and not walked or fed. On the way to the funeral home.  
I picked up his wife's sisters, and we went to the apartment to take care of the dog. 
She is a beautiful Doberman and she had not made any mess at all in the house. She would not let the sisters in the apartment,  
but I knew the dog well, and she allowed me to walk her out. On the street 
she could sense immediately that something was wrong, and she would not leave the exact spot where Martin was shot for a long time.  
Finally after a quick urination on the spot, she let me walk her down the street to take care of the rest of her business. 
Next we left for a quick stop at the funeral home to arrange the body retrieval and to move him to the place the funeral will take place."

that it had been released to an unscrupulous funeral director, and we could not locate it.  
Back and forth to the police station to help with locating the body.  
The friendly detectives that we had talked to in the morning were no longer at work, and a  
different batch of police were at the station. These people had other priorities and were not  
much interested in helping locate the body.  
In the end about 1:30 am we were able to negotiate a release of the body for money.  
His dead body was basically held hostage until I paid them for it. Of course it was very hot Friday,  
and it was already decomposing rapidly. 
The funeral parlor we took him to was kind and efficient. They did their very best in cleaning up the  
situation and were so professional. They have my recommendation if you ever happen to be dead in Manila.  
Call Sanctuarium. They provide complete services and it is a professional first class environment. 
By this time the dog has had a hard day with not enough food or water all day.  
So I brought her home and that ended the long sad day."

すまん、数日の間ネットから遠ざかってた。金曜の朝友人が彼のアパートメントの前で殺されてしまった。 
マニラでの死亡事件は（事後処理が）長引くし、ややこしいんだ。 
その朝私が自分のオフィスにつき、中に入ってエアコンのスイッチを入れたとき、彼の妻が電話してきた。 
「マーティンが襲われたわ！こっちに来て頂戴、助けて」 
私はすぐにオフィスを出て、電話をかけなおした。 
「医者を呼ぶんだ。私がつくまで少しかかる」 
「彼死んじゃったわ！」 
私が現場に到着したのはちょうど朝の７時前だった。 
黒山の人だかりが異様な好奇の目を以って、警察が遺体の処理をしてるまわりに集まっていた。 
警察は事件のことを聞くために彼の家族と私とを警察署に連れて行った。事情聴取は滞りなく進んだ。 
また事件の目撃者がいたので、警察は犯人の容貌を詳しく知ることができた。 
私たちは１０時半に署をでた。私は彼の妻と母を家に送った。 
ドイツ大使館に彼の死を知らせに寄ったが、大使館は金曜日には半日しか開いてない。 
私が着いたのは大使館が閉まったあとの１２時３０分だった。 
守衛は親切にも緊急連絡先の電話番号を教えてくれて、私はオフィスに戻りそこに電話した。 
ドイツ人というのはこのようなときに効率的に動く。 
私は彼の母の電話番号は知ってはいるものの、彼の本国の家族への連絡先は知らなかった。 
大使館はドイツ警察に連絡し、すぐに彼の家族に彼の死を伝えてくれた。 

>>339和訳 

マーティンにはまた日本に住む家族（＝子供）が２人いる。彼らとは連絡手段が無い。 
彼はいつも彼らのことについて私に話してたし、日本にいるその子供たちがたいそう恋しいと言っていた。 
私はどこで彼らが育ったのかを知っていた。そこは日本のとある地域で、私にも馴染みの場所だ。 
私はそこの近くに住むある友人に電話してみた。彼はその子供たちの居場所も人物も特定できた。感謝してる。 
子供たちがこのニュースをうまく受け入れられなかったことを私は聞いている。申し訳なく思う。 
いつか彼らが私に連絡をくれて、 
彼らが父親と最後に会った後に父親が何をやっていたのかを私が彼らに語ることができるのを願っている。 
私は遺体がどこに運ばれたかを知るために警察に電話した。 
警察は私にある葬儀場の名前を伝えた。そこで私はその葬儀屋の場所を調べ始めた。 
この間中、彼の飼っていた犬は彼のアパートメントに閉じ込められ、散歩もなし餌もなしだった。 
葬儀場に行く途中で、彼の妻の姉妹を拾って、犬の世話の為にアパートメントに行った。 
犬は美しい雌のドーベルマンで、家の中で暴れた形跡は無かった。 
彼女（犬）は彼の妻の姉妹を中に入れさせなかった。 
しかし私は彼女と馴染みの関係であったから、彼女は私が彼女を外に連れ出すのにおとなしく従った。 
道に出ると、彼女はすぐに違和感を感じたらしく、マーティンが撃たれたまさにその場所から長い間動かなかった。 
ようやく、ちょっと尿を出してその場所にマーキングすると、 
（アパートで）残りの雑用をするために私が彼女を引いて道を歩き出すのに従った。 
次に私たちは、彼の遺体を修復して葬式が行われる場所に運ぶ手続きをするために、葬儀場内のquick stop（受付？）に向かった。 

>>340和訳 

このとき、だいたい午後２時だった。 
しかし遺体はここになく、驚いたことに悪徳葬儀屋のところに送られていて、私たちには場所が分からなかった。 
再び警察署に行って、遺体の場所を探す助力を求めた。 
私たちが朝に会話した感じのいい警官たちはもう交代していて、違う警官の集団が署にいた。 
この人たちはもっと優先すべき仕事があり、遺体の場所を探すことを手伝うことに関心はあまりなかった。 
結局、午前１時半になって、私たちは交渉し、金を払って死体を返してもらった。 
彼の遺体は私が彼らに金を払うまで基本的に人質だったのだ。 
とても暑い金曜日で、すでに急速に腐敗しかけていた。 
私たちが彼を運んだ葬儀屋は親切で有能だった。彼らはその状況をきれいにするために最善を尽くし、またはなはだ熟練していた。 
もしあなたがマニラで死んだら、私は彼らの店を勧める。Sanctuarium（葬儀屋名？）に電話しなさい。 
彼らは完璧なサービスを提供する。この葬儀屋はプロの第一級の環境だ。 
時ここに至って、犬にとって一日中食事も水も満足でなくきつい日だったことに気がついた。 
そこで私は彼女を家に連れ帰り、長く悲しい一日を終えた。"

Do you know how difficult it is to shoot the eclipse? Well, I've never seen it with my eyes, but since the moon is very far, we need to go by telephotography. 
And since the eclipse emits very little light, we need a long exposure that unable us to shoot the moon without a tripod.

trip generator was modified. 
from ahiru-chan's guide;  

■Guide to new trip system 

1) to keep old 10-letter trip 
　　　if your key was shorter than 11 letters: no adaptation required. 
　　　if your key was longer than 11 letters: shorten the key to 11 letters. same trip will be generated.  
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Multi-byte characters are counted as 2 letters) 
2) to use new 12-letter trip 
　　　simply use a longer key. at least 12 is required. 

3) to use ""Raw Key"" mode(new!) 
　type ##xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxnn　where 
　　　x: ASCII Code in hexadecimal (8 letters) 
　　　n: hash salt(optional) 

NOTE: new trip system now bypasses word replacement command such as s/◆/◇/ or s/山崎渉/fusianasan/ . 
　　　　 and some of keys contain those letters or phrases may need to be modified."
527	erobbs	1238806339	528			sage	MUMUMUhnYI		2009-06-20 11:14:55	J53bPeYW	" Jim-san, 

We began new trip system from yesterday. It is pretty secure the traditional one. 

But don't panic. It has packward compatibility. You can use the traditional version 
of trip when you specify the first 8 characters as your trip seed. 

So, for example, if you use #(over 12 characters) as trip string, the system will 
generate the new trip automatically. 

The new trip is SHA-1 based and it generates 12 characters of hash string. 
And the traditional trip is DES based and it generates 10 characters of hash string. 

As of course you already know, DES is no longer secure, so we need introduce 
the pretty good authentication system. 

But it must has compatibility because the traditional version is widely deployed 
already, and the ""Moritapo"" system (operated by Brazil inc.) uses it. 

In short, you can use your original trip string by specifying the first 8 characters. 
(after the ninth, ignored by nature, it derived from DES specification) 

But I recommend users use the new version. It is pretty secure against reverse analyzing. 

Regards, 
-- Mumumu"

It is employment of the translator. 

There is a language barrier in Japanese and American's Jim-san. 
Simple communications are possible. 
However, I think that the translator is necessary for complex communications. 

There are volunteer's several translators in PINK. 
However, it doesn't function though it is regrettable. 
I aspire after the translator who regularly visits the translation thread. 
I think that employment is preferable to volunteers. 
I hope Jim-san examines this matter.

Yes, the betrayal is the worst thing. When you can't count on those 
close to you. Even if they are no longer so close, but have been. 
Then you are really in a super bad position. It can make someone 
paranoid with no place to turn. Of course no normal person wants 
their family or close friends to be in trouble. Drug trouble is a  
kind of sickness like alcoholism. Helping your friend or family get 
treatment confidentially is the best choice. Allowing law enforcement

He doesn't use the trip at all.  
If he was using the trip, the situation was avoided. 
Because if megami and residents register trip NG,  
it is settled with it.  
He understands it well, and is using two or more ID at the same time. 
In addition, camouflaging as if a lot of residents  
were enjoying the killing megami 
and making and playing by oneself(strawman sockpuppet) are purpose.

He misunderstood the megami who did not reveal the name

He abused the megami as the dependence syndrome.

The re-distribution that doesn't obtain the permission
